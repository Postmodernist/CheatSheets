NETWORK

Utilities

    wget file               download file
    wget -c file            continue stopped download
    wget -r url             recursively download files from url

    ifconfig                network info (old)
    curl ipinfo.io/ip
    curl ifconfig.me        your external IP
    netstat -tnlp           list all listening ports
    lsof -i                 show real-time network activity
    ping host
    whois domain            get whois for domain
    dig domain              get DNS for domain
    dig -x host             reverse lookup host
    vnstat                  network traffic monitor

    Remotely edit a file:
      nano scp://user@host//path
    
SSH

    ssh user@host                   connect to host as a user
    ssh -p port user@host           connect using given port
    ssh -D port user@host           connect and use bind port

    ssh-add                         add key to system
    cat ~/.id_rsa.pub               view the public key
    nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys     add a public key on a server

    Mount network filesystem:
        - host machine must have openssh-server installed
        - regular 'ssh user@host' connection must work
        - 'sshfs' is used w/o sudo, so mount_point has to be in home directory
      sshfs user@host:path ~/mount_point

    SSH through host in the middle:
      ssh -t reachable_host ssh unreachable_host
      
File transfer

    scp -P port user@host:path local_path   copy file
    scp -r user@host:path local_path        copy dir

TMUX

    tmux a                  attach to last session
    tmux list-sessions      list tmux sessions
    tmux a -t number        attach to session by number
    ctrl + b, d             detach from current session
    ctrl + b, pgup          view history mode
